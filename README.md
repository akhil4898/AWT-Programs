# JAVA AWT  AND EVENTS

 * Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) is an API to develop GUI or window-based applications in java.

* Java AWT components are platform-dependent i.e. components are displayed according to the view of operating system. AWT is heavyweight i.e. its components are using the resources of OS.

* Event Handling is the mechanism that controls the event and decides what should happen if an event occurs. This mechanism has a code which is known as an event handler, that is executed when an event occurs. Java uses the Delegation Event Model to handle the events.
